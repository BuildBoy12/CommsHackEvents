# P and S (used below, in compatible events.)
**What does P and S mean?**

**P means player. This means that you can also use %playerName (S), %playerDisplayName (S), %playerRank (S), %playerRankColor (S), %playerRole (S), %playerSide (S)**

**Attempting to use %player will result in an error, instead, use one of the strings of text instead above.**

**S means string. This means that it is just text.**
